# Social Media Strategy

For Aletheia to be successful we need a social media strategy that our social media team can take direction from.

We need to be active on multiple platforms
We have
Facebook
Twitter

We need to look at
Instagram, photos of events and users conducting research

approach the vocal minority of researchers who are against paywalls

engage the anti-paywall movement

approach conferences to host papers

approach universities for nodes, moral case, maybe faster
