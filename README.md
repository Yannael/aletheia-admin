## First thing's first, what is Aletheia?

In short, Aletheia is software for getting science published and into the hands of everyone, for free. It's a decentralised and distributed database used as a publishing platform for scientific research.

So, Aletheia is software. But software without people is nothing. To comprehensively answer the question what is Aletheia, Aletheia is software surrounded by a community of people who want to change the world through open access to scientific knowledge. 

## OK, so why does this project exist?

A large percentage of scientific papers published are behind paywalls. That is to say, a huge segment of the world's population is cut off from scientific knowledge. Don't take our word for it. [Here](https://medium.com/@jasonschmitt/can-t-disrupt-this-elsevier-and-the-25-2-billion-dollar-a-year-academic-publishing-business-aa3b9618d40a), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Criticism_and_controversies), [here](https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/11/elsevier-beyond-the-pale-of-scientific-respectability/) and [here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/02/academics-boycott-publisher-elsevier) are some links to get you started reading about this problem. Paywalls entrench economic privilege, lower global standards and stifle global innovation. Humanity as an entire race loses out, and that means you. You lose, no matter who you are.  

If you want a good primer to the problems surrounding academic publishing and how technology can be applied to them, please set aside two hours of your time and watch [_The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet%27s_Own_Boy)

## That's a terrible problem! How do we solve it?

We open science up. For-profit academic publishers host scientific research and organise the peer review process, there's no reason why a community of people can't do that. In creating Aletheia, we are building a publishing platform that handles the peer review process for scientific articles that is also a search engine for accessing papers. Anyone can publish through us, have their work peer reviewed, and anyone can access the entire Aletheia database, all for free.

We have the ability to create such software and we have the ability to organise a community around it, there is no reason we cannot build the world we want.

## So we get science to the people. How will this change things?

The community around Aletheia share a common vision, to change the world. That sounds very lofty and vague, but this vision is very real and very achievable. For the founders of Aletheia, changing the world means giving everyone with an internet connection access to humanity's collective knowledge. This will do two things. 

1. If schools and universities don't have to pay [exorbitant fees](http://gantercourses.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Faculty-Advisory-Council-Memorandum-on-Journal-Pricing-%C2%A7-THE-HARVARD-LIBRARY.pdf) for access to a narrow range research papers and instead have a wide range of papers available for free, students have more material and the subscription funds can go back to teaching. [Quality of education is a large factor in social mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Influence_of_intelligence_and_education). 

2. If we have more people reading more scientific research, statistically we are going to get more people that put the dots together and discover scientific breakthroughs. 

A faster rising middle class across the world coupled with more scientific breakthroughs leads us to a world we can scarcely imagine. The end of poverty, the halting of climate change, infinite renewable energy, unlocking the aging process, all of this is possible. The future lies before us, the founder's vision is let's get there, faster.

Changing the world for you could be as simple as [preventing a loved one dying of cancer because someone had access to information they would not otherwise have had and invented an early detection test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Andraka#Pancreatic_cancer_sensor), or it could be even bigger than the founder's vision. That's the beauty of it, the vision is yours, yours to share as part of a community looking to turn that personal vision into reality.

## Is it all about science?

No, there is more to it. Science is the area we feel Aletheia can make the largest impact as fast as possible, but it's clear a distrubuted and decentralised database that is designed to be hard to dismantle and is free to use has a number of applications. One of the goals of Aletheia is to prove this technology works so we can get to those other applications. Along with science, Aletheia is about advancing decentralised technology, making it opensource and bringing it to multiple industries.

Another goal is to prove a new governance model. Aletheia is run by the community, its envisioned that the community with run clients that collectively form the Aletheia database, the community will vote on the contents of the database and what gets taken down. The community will propose, vote on a write new features of Aletheia. This notion of a group of people organising around a software platform that has no overarching governance structure is called a DAO, a [decentralised autonomous organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_Autonomous_Organization). DAOs already exist, but they aren't common currently. With Aletheia we want to prove that DAOs are viable and bring the idea of community governace to the mainstream.

## This sounds amazing! Can I join?

Yes! Anyone and everyone can participate. Aletheia is currently under construction and we are seeking developers and designers to get the platform up on its feet and community organisers to coordinate efforts. 

If you do have some design or technical skills, we are especially looking for:
* Web developers
* Front end designers
* Anyone familiar with decentralised technology, blockchain, solidity, anything like that
* Security engineers

If you're more of a people person, we are looking for:
* Social media managers
* Volunteer coordinators
* Media liaisons
* Grant proposal writers
* Technical writers

However, do not feel that you are limited to these roles. We are open to any form of contribution.

## So I can be a part of this community. How do I start?

## Who will I be interacting with once I join?

Aletheia was founded by two people, Kade and Roo. Kade sat down one day and decided he was going to do something about the problems with academic publishing outlined in the documentary _The Internet's Own Boy_. He came up with the idea for a publishing platform that was run by a community, free for anyone to use and access. He spoke about his idea to Roo, the two decided to make the idea a reality, and how you're reading the README file in their GitHub. Action can be that simple, and we invite you to join us.

Currently Aletheians interact over [Slack](https://aletheiafoundation.slack.com). Drop an email  to the below address if you would like an invite.

## How is Aletheia licensed? Can I use the material and source code in these repos to make my own creation?

Aletheia was founded on the principle that knowledge should be open and that software should be open. In this spirit a large amount of Aletheia is licensed under *Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0* license and *GNU General Public License v3.0* for materials and source code respectively. These licenses mean you can take Aletheia and create something else from it, however you must also make whatever you create open for others to do the same with. The second however is that we have taken the contents from other repositories to help create Aletheia, and this material is licensed differently. When forking Aletheia to create your own work be mindful that separate repositories are licensed differently.
