_**Publish science for free, access science for free.**_

## Welcome

First up, :tada::confetti_ball::tada: welcome! :tada::confetti_ball::tada:
Thank you for checking out Aletheia. To find out what we are about and how you can fit into that if you so choose, keep scrolling!

## What are we doing?

In short, we are building a community to solve a problem.

## The problem  :pensive:

A large percentage of scientific articles lie behind paywalls. That is to say, a large percentage of humanity’s collective knowledge is only accessible by those with financial means. The companies that operate these paywalls claim the paywalls exist to cover their operating costs, costs that allow science to be published. But the truth is these companies operate with a large profit margin. Don't take our word for it. [Here](https://medium.com/@jasonschmitt/can-t-disrupt-this-elsevier-and-the-25-2-billion-dollar-a-year-academic-publishing-business-aa3b9618d40a), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Criticism_and_controversies), [here](https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/11/elsevier-beyond-the-pale-of-scientific-respectability/) and [here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/02/academics-boycott-publisher-elsevier) are some links to get you started. The fact that scientific research is not freely available to all, people in the developing world, people im the first world, boys and girls, rich and poor, lowers global education standards and stifles innovation. We don't know what breakthroughs we are missing by keeping research out of the hands of so many. Humanity as an entire races loses out, all because some academic publishers want to line their pockets. It's morally wrong and it's extremely shortsighted from a pragmatic viewpoint, the people running these companies would benefit from scientific breakthroughs just as much as the average person on the street.

## The solution :heart_eyes:

We open science up. For profit academic publishsers host scientific research and organise the peer review process, there's no reason why the community can't do that. In creating Aletheia, we are building a publishing platform that handles the peer review process for scientific articles that also doubles as a search engine, interating across a blockchain containing the records of articles published through Aletheia. Anyone can publish through us, have their work peer reviewed, and anyone can access the entire Aletheia database, all for free. 

If you want a good primer to the problems surrounding academic publishing and how technology can be applied to them, please set aside two hours of your time and watch [_The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet%27s_Own_Boy)

## Who are we? :sunglasses: :sunglasses:

Aletheia was founded by two people, Kade and Roo. Kade sat down one day and decided he was going to do something about the problems with academic publishing outlined in the documentary _The Internet's Own Boy_. He came up with the idea for a publishing platform that was run by a community, free for anyone to use and access. He spoke about his idea to Roo, the two decided to make the idea a reality, and how you're reading the README file in their GitHub. Action can be that simple, and we invite you to join us.

## The vision for Aletheia

The community around Aletheia share a common vision, to change the world. That sounds very lofty and vague, but this vision is very real and very achieveable. For the founders of Aletheia, Kade and Roo, changing the world means giving everyone with an internet connection access to humanity's collective knowledge. If schools and universities don't have to pay [exorbitant fees](http://gantercourses.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Faculty-Advisory-Council-Memorandum-on-Journal-Pricing-%C2%A7-THE-HARVARD-LIBRARY.pdf) for access to a narrow range research papers, students could have access to a wider range of materials and that money can go back to teaching. This improves educational quality. [Education is a large factor in social mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Influence_of_intelligence_and_education). If we have more people reading more scientific research, statistically we are going to get more people that put the dots together and discover scientific breakthroughs. A faster rising middle class all across the world coupled with more scientific breakthroughs leads us to a world we can scarcely imagine. The end of poverty, the halting of climate change, infinite renewable energy, unlocking the aging process, all this is possible. The future lies before us, let's get there, faster.

That is what changing the world means to the founders of Aletheia. Changing the world for you could be as simple as preventing a loved one dying of [cancer because someone had access to information they would not otherwise have had and invented an early detection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Andraka#Pancreatic_cancer_sensor), or it could be even bigger than the founder's dreams. That's the beauty of it, the vision is yours, yours to share as part of a community looking to turn that person vision of yours into reality.

## What do we need?

:couple: :family: :two_men_holding_hands: :two_women_holding_hands: :dancer: :dancers: :ok_woman: :boy: :girl: :woman: :man: :baby: :older_woman: :older_man: :man_with_turban: :construction_worker: :cop: :angel: :princess: :dragon_face:
Anyone and everyone to participate! Aletheia is currently under construction and we are seeking developers and designers. But just as software doesn’t write itself, communities don’t build themselves either, we are open to any form of contribution to our community.

If you do have some design or technical skills, we are especially looking for:
* Web developers
* Front end designers
* Anyone familiar with decentralised technology, blockchain, solidity, anything like that
* Security engineers

If you're more of a people person, we are looking for:
* Social media managers
* Volunteer coordinators
* Media liaisons
* Grant proposal writers
* Technical writers

As said above, do not feel that you are limited to these roles. The above are just want we've found would be useful, but you don't know what you don't know. We are open to any form of contribution to our community.

## Thank you

Seriously, :tada::confetti_ball::tada: thank you! :tada::confetti_ball::tada: It means a lot to us that you read this far!

Aletheia cannot exist without a community so a sincere thank you for taking the time to look at our project. We hope to see you contributing, to building Aletheia or interacting as part of our community once we are up and running!
