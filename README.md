_**Publish science for free, access science for free.**_

## Welcome

First up, :tada::confetti_ball::tada: welcome! :tada::confetti_ball::tada:
Thank you for checking out Aletheia. 

## First thing is first. What is Aletheia?

In short, Aletheia software for getting scientific research published and in the hands of everyone, for free. If you want a little more detail, Aletheia is a decentralised and distributed database used as a free publishing platform for scientific research.

So, Aletheia is software. But software without people is nothing. To comprehensively answer the question what is Aletheia, Aletheia is software surrounded by a community of people who want to change the world through open access to scientific knowledge. 

## OK, so why does this project exist?

A large percentage of scientific papers published sit behind paywalls. That is to say, a huge segment of the world's population is cut off from scientific knowledge. Don't take our word for it. [Here](https://medium.com/@jasonschmitt/can-t-disrupt-this-elsevier-and-the-25-2-billion-dollar-a-year-academic-publishing-business-aa3b9618d40a), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Criticism_and_controversies), [here](https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/11/elsevier-beyond-the-pale-of-scientific-respectability/) and [here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/02/academics-boycott-publisher-elsevier) are some links to get you started reading about this problem. Paywalls entrench economic privilege, lower global standards and stile global innovation. Humanity as an entire race loses out, that means you. You lose, no matter who you are.  

If you want a good primer to the problems surrounding academic publishing and how technology can be applied to them, please set aside two hours of your time and watch [_The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet%27s_Own_Boy)

## That's a terrible problem! How do we solve it?

We open science up. For-profit academic publishers host scientific research and organise the peer review process, there's no reason why a community of people can't do that. In creating Aletheia, we are building a publishing platform that handles the scientific peer review process for scientific articles that also doubles as a search engine for accessing scientific papers. Anyone can publish through us, have their work peer reviewed, and anyone can access the entire Aletheia database, all for free.

We have the ability to create such software and we have the ability to organise a community around it, there is no reason we cannot build the world we want.

## So we get science to the people. How will this change things?

The community around Aletheia share a common vision, to change the world. That sounds very lofty and vague, but this vision is very real and very achievable. For the founders of Aletheia, changing the world means giving everyone with an internet connection access to humanity's collective knowledge. This will do two things. 

1. If schools and universities don't have to pay [exorbitant fees](http://gantercourses.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Faculty-Advisory-Council-Memorandum-on-Journal-Pricing-%C2%A7-THE-HARVARD-LIBRARY.pdf) for access to a narrow range research papers and instead have a wide range of papers available for free, students have more material and the subscription funds can go back to teaching. [Education is a large factor in social mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Influence_of_intelligence_and_education). 

2. If we have more people reading more scientific research, statistically we are going to get more people that put the dots together and discover scientific breakthroughs. 

A faster rising middle class across the world coupled with more scientific breakthroughs leads us to a world we can scarcely imagine. The end of poverty, the halting of climate change, infinite renewable energy, unlocking the aging process, all this is possible. The future lies before us, the founder's vision is let's get there, faster.

Changing the world for you could be as simple as [preventing a loved one dying of cancer because someone had access to information they would not otherwise have had and invented an early detection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Andraka#Pancreatic_cancer_sensor), or it could be even bigger than the founder's vision. That's the beauty of it, the vision is yours, yours to share as part of a community looking to turn that personal vision into reality.

## This all sounds amazing! Can I join?

:couple: :family: :two_men_holding_hands: :two_women_holding_hands: :dancer: :dancers: :ok_woman: :boy: :girl: :woman: :man: :baby: :older_woman: :older_man: :man_with_turban: :construction_worker: :cop: :angel: :princess: :dragon_face:
Yes! Anyone and everyone to participate. Aletheia is currently under construction and we are seeking developers and designers to get the platform up on its feet and community organisers to coordinate efforts. 

If you do have some design or technical skills, we are especially looking for:
* Web developers
* Front end designers
* Anyone familiar with decentralised technology, blockchain, solidity, anything like that
* Security engineers

If you're more of a people person, we are looking for:
* Social media managers
* Volunteer coordinators
* Media liaisons
* Grant proposal writers
* Technical writers

However, do not feel that you are limited to these roles. The above are just what we've found would be useful, we are open to any form of contribution.

## So I can be a part of this community. How do I start?

Below are some useful resources:
* [Aletheia whitepaper](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/whitepaper) - this will give you fully formed idea of the vision and goals of Aletheia.
* [Our Lean Canvas build plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Joti0YzRRg9qDcwiIjfHtvckJNUCguQJol9K22GriFE/edit#slide=id.p) - the condensed version of our vision and goals.
* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/admin/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) - the Code of Conduct we expect all Aletheians to abide by.
* [Contributor guidelines](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/admin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR-GUIDELINES.md) - if you're looking to contribute here are some guidelines to get you started.
* [Roadmap](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/admin/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) - want to see where we're at in the project, or looking for open issues to contribute to? Look no further.

## Who will I be interacting with once I join?

Aletheia was founded by two people, Kade and Roo. Kade sat down one day and decided he was going to do something about the problems with academic publishing outlined in the documentary _The Internet's Own Boy_. He came up with the idea for a publishing platform that was run by a community, free for anyone to use and access. He spoke about his idea to Roo, the two decided to make the idea a reality, and how you're reading the README file in their GitHub. Action can be that simple, and we invite you to join us.

## Can I contact Aletheia and/or follow Aletheia for news about the project, science and open access?

You can reach out to us on the below:
* contact@aletheia-foundation.io
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aletheia_f)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aletheiaf)

If you want to reach out to one of the founders individually:

## Thank you

Seriously, :tada::confetti_ball::tada: thank you! :tada::confetti_ball::tada: It means a lot to us that you read this far! If you want go a step further and help to build a better world through Aletheia, feel free to join us.
