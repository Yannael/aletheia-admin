## Personas

Personas are a thought exercise in thinking about potential contributors and users and looking at how they would engage with the project to indentify any barriers and make improvements. These people are completely ficticious.

Saanvi Chavan is studying a Master of Arts in Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology at Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute in Pune, India. Saanvi loves the scooter her parents saved up and bought her when she started studying and friends often ask her for lifts. She enjoys spending time at ABC Farms. Saanvi heard one of her lecturers talk about research a colleague was set to publish that's pertinent to her masters course, and after getting the name of the journal she checked with the university library. They said they don't carry a subscription to that journal. Saanvi searched online and found to purchase the article from the journal directly costs roughly $50 US, more than she can afford.

## Contribute

To ensure we have a diverse range of personas, Aletheians are encouraged to create their own personas and add them here. Images should be taken from a creative commons search, or be images you have rights to.

Use this rough formula but feel free to add whatever you think is pertinent for the exercise.
* One sentence naming your persona and covering what they do for study, employment, etc.
* Two sentences listing some facts about our person to make them believeable, coving things like family and pastimes.
* Three sentences explaining why they might want to use Aletheia, including reasons why they may be predisposed towards or against Aletheia
