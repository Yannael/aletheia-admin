_**Publish science for free, access science for free.**_

## Personas

Personas are a thought exercise in thinking about potential contributors and users and looking at how they would engage with the project to indentify any barriers and make improvements. These people are completely ficticious. 

## Saanvi Chavan

Saanvi Chavan is studying a Master of Arts in Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology at Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute in Pune, India. Saanvi loves the scooter she saved up and bought for herself when she started studying, it gives her a sense of independence from her sometimes overbearing family. When not studying she enjoys spending time at ABC Farms. Saanvi heard one of her lecturers talk about research a colleague was set to publish that's pertinent to her masters course, and after getting the name of the journal she checked with the university library. They said they don't carry a subscription to that journal and Saanvi isn't terribly confient in her technical, if she can't find the journal from a basic search she's resigned herself to the fact she won't get the information. Saanvi found the journal online, but to purchase the article from the journal directly costs roughly $50 US, she can't afford it herself, doesn't want to burden her parents by asking for money, and doesn't know how else she could source it.

## Klaus Müller

Klaus Müller is a lecturer at Justus-liebig-Universität Gießen, teaching as part of the school of Mathematics and Computer Science, Physics and Geography. He has a wife and three kids, tells terrible dad jokes and constantly embarisses his children at parent teacher conferences. His family don't understand his fascination with computers and he spends a great deal of time contributing to opensource projects. Klaus publishes his research at great cost and sees open access journals as inferior quality and anything that doesn't have a cost attached just isn't right. He tells himself the reason he has to pay great sums of money to be published is science is expensive and must be maintained, he believes Sci-Hub and other websites that pirate scientific research are killing academia. To Klaus, blockchain is a fad, it has not proved itself yet and anything built on it offering scientific research for free will go by the wayside once people wisen up.

## Jean Elokobi

![contributor1](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/200000/velka/central-african-man.jpg)

Jean Elokobi is a social worker living in Garoua, Cameroon. In his spare time he enjoys playing the saxaphone, subbing in for a number of local bands. He is fluent in French, English and Fulfulde and has a burning desire to travel. Jean has found through his work he is often interacting with children or with young families, and he often wonders what can be done to support education in Cameroon. While only having a small exposure to coding, an out of school elective in C++ while studying at Université Catholique de l'Afrique Centrale, Jean is looking for ways to engage primary and highschool students with technology. He finds a lot of tech communities to be alienating though, not welcoming to people with non-technical backgrounds, and he's mindful of giving students positive interactions with technology as he knows through his work if students aren't engaged they will switch off.
