# Contributing to Aletheia

Thank you for wanting to contribute!

## What should I know before I get started?

### The vision for Aletheia

Aletheia is a community run decentralised and distributed database used as a publishing platform for scientific research. The [README](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/admin) is your introduction to the project and the overarching vision of what we are trying to achieve together. You can also get a snapshot of what we're all about from our [website](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/aletheia-foundation.github.io/blob/master/about.md). Finally, for the dedicated among you, there is the [whitepaper](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/whitepaper). 

### The Code of Conduct

We have one, it is located [here](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/admin/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md), please look over before contributing.

### What's already been done/is underway?

To give you an idea of where we've come from, what ground we've already covered, where we are going adn what needs doing, check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/admin/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

### I'm now up to speed and I want to contribute!

Aletheia is not just software, it's a community, so contributing takes many forms.

* Do you want to contribute to Aletheia by writing code for the software? If so, this document outlines how you can do that. The below guidelines for contributing to the software are just that, guidelines, not hard and fast rules that must be adhered to. We ask that you use your best judgement and as a rule of thumb, put yourself in the shoes of the project maintainers. If you ran a project and someone submitted what you are going to submit, does it make sense? Is it appropriate? Is it something you would want to see?

* Do you want to contribute to Aletheia through other means (such as helping with social media, being a part of the community voting process that's outlined in the whitepaper, or any other means that come to mind)? If so, please email contact@aletheia-foundation.io and contributions will be handled on a case by case basis.

Feel free to look over the issues in each of the repositories (there are technical and non-technical issues) and if there's one you want to work on, let us know. Non techies, this is where you leave off, techies continue on!

### The basic structure of Aletheia

To ensure you are contributing to the right repo it's a good idea to understand how Aletheia is put together. 

**Overveiw of repos and the different pieces of Aletheia coming soon**

## How can I contribute?

### Report bugs

Once Aletheia is up and running (which it isn't currently) we will need people to report bugs. First you must:

* **Check** the [outstanding issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aaletheia-foundation+) Aletheia has currently. Someone may have already reported it.
* **Determine** which repo the issue should be opened against, this is why it is a good idea to have a rough idea of Aletheia's building blocks. Not how they work, just want they are.

Once you have followed these steps you are ready to submit your bug report. Bugs are reported as GitHub issues.  

* navigate to the desired repo, click **Issues** from the options running along the top of the page, then click the green **"New Issue"** button. 

To make your bug report as useful to others as possible, please consider the below and try to answer as many of them as possible:

**Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:**

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. 
* Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
* Explain what behaviour you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots where possible. 
* If you're reporting that Alethia crashed, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system if possible. Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.
* If the problem is related to performance, include a CPU profile capture and a screenshot with your report if possible.
* If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

**Provide more context by answering these questions:**

* Can you reproduce the problem in safe mode?
* Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of Aletheia) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Aletheia? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? 
* Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

**Include details about your configuration and environment:**

* Which version of Aletheia are you using? 
* What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
* Are you running Aletheia in a virtual machine? If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* Are you using Aletheia with multiple monitors? If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
* Which keyboard layout are you using? Are you using a US layout or some other layout?

## Making/suggesting enhancements

It would be great if our software did exactly what we wanted, and it can, that's the whole point of opensource. In that spirit if you have an enhancement you'd like to suggest and you know some programming, you are encouraged to work on the enhancement here on GitHub. If you don't know any programming you're encouraged to learn, it's a great skill! But in the meantime you can suggest an enhancement that someone else might build.

### Making an enhancement

* **Check** the [outstanding issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aaletheia-foundation+) Aletheia has currently. Someone may be planning to work on something similar.
* **Read** the latest version of the [whitepaper](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/whitepaper) first. This will align you with the project vision. 
* **Email** contact@aletheia-foundation.io to discuss your enhancement before you start. Aletheia has been designed to overcome problems in very particular ways, and we need to ensure the the enhancement meshes with the rest of Aletheia and isn't something already being worked on. We don't want your time and effort to go to waste. Down the track it is envisaged that the go/no go call for an enhancement will be made by the community in keeping with Aletheia's principles of decentralisation.

### Suggesting an enhancement

* **Check** the [outstanding issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aaletheia-foundation+) Aletheia has currently. Someone may have already reported it.
* **Determine** which repo the enhancement should be opened against, this is why it is a good idea to have a rough idea of Aletheia's building blocks. Not how they work, just want they are.

Once you have followed these steps you are ready to submit your enhancement suggestion. Enhancements are suggested through GitHub issues much the same way bugs are reported.  

* navigate to the desired repo, click **Issues** from the options running along the top of the page, then click the green **"New Issue"** button. 

To make your enhancement suggestion as useful to others as possible, please consider the below and try to answer as many of them as possible:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks if possible.
* Describe the current behaviour and explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Aletheia which the suggestion is related to. 
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Aletheia users.
* List some other applications where this enhancement exists.
* Specify which version of Aletheia you're using. 
* Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.
