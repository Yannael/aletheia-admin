# Aletheia

_**Publish science for free, access science for free.**_

## Milestone: Ongoing issues

General to do things

## Milestone: Mozilla Tech Speakers

Kade is currently going through the Mozilla Tech Speakers program that will help him become a better evangelist for Aletheia and opensource tech overall

## Milestone: Mozilla Open Leadership

## Milestone: Instagram account

Kade hates instagram but has seen it used for effective marketing elsewhere. The goal is contributors can send in photos of them working on Aletheia, being part of the community, or if they are researchers they can send in photos out in the field or in the lab.

* [Get the blog working](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/aletheia-foundation.github.io/issues/6)
