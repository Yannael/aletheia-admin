## Shelved Milestones

* Milestone: Instagram account - currently being debated by the Aletheia community

Kade hates instagram but has seen it used for effective marketing elsewhere. The goal is contributors can send in photos of them working on Aletheia, being part of the community, or if they are researchers they can send in photos out in the field or in the lab.
