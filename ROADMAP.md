# Aletheia

_**Publish science for free, access science for free.**_

## Milestone: Mozilla Tech Speakers

Kade is currently going through the Mozilla Tech Speakers program that will help him become a better evangelist for Aletheia and tech overall

## Milestone: Mozilla Open Leadership

Kade is currently going through the Mozilla Open Leadership program to teach him how to run Aletheia as an opensource project

## Milestone: Instagram account

Kade hates instagram but has seen it used for effective marketing elsewhere. The goal is contributors can send in photos of them working on Aletheia, being part of the community, or if they are researchers they can send in photos out in the field or in the lab.

## Milestone: Website

We need to enhance our web presence.

## Milestone: Minimum Viable Product

A client you can upload documents to, search, and download documents from. This is our proof of concept

## Milestone: Aletheia 2.0

Adding features to the client that will give it a point of difference from other open access scientific journals
