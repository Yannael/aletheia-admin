## Milestone: Mozilla Tech Speakers

## Milestone: Mozilla Open Leadership

Kade is currently going through the Mozilla Open Leadership program to teach him how to run Aletheia as an opensource project

## Milestone: Instagram account

Kade hates instagram but has seen it used for effective marketing elsewhere. The goal is contributors can send in photos of them working on Aletheia, being part of the community, or if they are researchers they can send in photos out in the field or in the lab.
