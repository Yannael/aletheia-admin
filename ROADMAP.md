_**Publish research for free, access research for free.**_

## Mission and Summary

Aletheia is a decentralised open access scientific journal. Think of it as a peer to peer (P2P) publishing platform and database all rolled into one. You can submit original scientific research or existing non copyrighted research to help build up our library, and you can access our library to download articles, all free of charge!

## Shelved Milestones

* Milestone: Instagram account - currently being debated by the Aletheia community

Kade hates instagram but has seen it used for effective marketing elsewhere. The goal is contributors can send in photos of them working on Aletheia, being part of the community, or if they are researchers they can send in photos out in the field or in the lab.
