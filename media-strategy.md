## Social media
Aletheia needs to be active on multiple social media platforms. The goal is to have an update on all channels at least once a day, if possible at times that coincide with high usage patterns of our audience. Along with the below, other channels need to be explored and leveraged.

### Channels we currently have
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aletheiaf)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aletheia_f)

### Channels identified to utilise
* Instagram, people can submit photos to contact@aletheia-foundation.io of Aletheia events or activities related to material published by Aletheia such as field or lab research that will be posted on the Instagram account.

 Meeting regularly in-person with your Club helps you manage your Executive and engage with your community members. For all types of meetings, it’s important to book a space on campus in advance, and write an agenda to keep the meeting on track. There are four types of meetings you can run:

    Executive meetings: These meetings are for you and your Executive team. In these meetings you should check in with each Executive to see which areas they need support with. These meetings should happen once every week so that you can keep up to date with what your Executive team is working on. They can be vary in length, and may not require an official agenda, but everyone should be aware of the structure of the meeting.

    Regular meetings: These meetings are open to all members. This is where you can update your members on what each Executive member is working on and let them know how they can be involved in the Club. It’s up to you how often you’d like to host a regular meeting. We recommend hosting these meetings once per month.

    General meetings: General meetings should happen 1-2 times per year. This is where you can vote on new policies and elect your new Club Captain and Executive team. You should give at least 2 weeks advance notice before running a general meeting to give members time to plan to attend. These meetings will steer the direction of the future of your Campus Club.

3.1 Holding regular events.

Once you have established a venue, members, volunteers and a learning plan, the show must start! Whether they're hackathons, workshops, building or meet-ups, you should plan regular fun events to keep your membership engaged. Read and share with your volunteers Facilitation Tips from the Mozilla Participation team.

3.2 Sharing with the world.

Keep posting about your experiences, events, new members, volunteers, wins and lessons learned. Read these guides about Public Relations and Social Media for marketing your Mozilla Club.
