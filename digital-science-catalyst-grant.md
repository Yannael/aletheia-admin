_**Publish research for free, access research for free.**_

# Digital Science Catalyst Grant Proposal

## Abstract

In short, Aletheia is software for getting science published and into the hands of everyone, for free. It's a decentralised and distributed database used as a publishing platform for scientific research.

For a more in depth explanation, Aletheia is an Ethereum Blockchain application utilising IPFS for decentralised storage that anyone can upload documents to, download documents from, that also handles the academic peer review process. The application runs on individual PCs, all forming part of the IPFS database. This gives us an open source platform that cannot be bought out by the large publishers (and any derivitives of the platform source code must also be open source) that should also be hard to take down due to database nodes being spread across the globe in multiple legal jurisdictions. Aletheia is designed to be a resilient platform run transparently by the community, not some black box corporation or editorial board, meaning all users can see the decisions Aletheia is making and have a stake in that decision making process if they so desire. By this nature, Aletheia is decentralised, it has no key person risk. Should the core group who invented Aletheia dissapear Aletheia won't cease to exist, it will continue to be run by the community. The community moderates content through various mechanisms (peer review, reputation scores etc.,) to ensure quality of content.

## Team

[Kade Morton](linkedin.com/in/kade-morton-34179283) and [Roo](https://github.com/roo2) co-founded Aletheia. Kade works as a security consultant and Roo works as a software developer.

Aletheia's volunteer team consists of:
Chris
Kolt
Lisa
Michael
Ameen
r3versi 
Rachel
Rob
Yann-Aël

We've reached out to [Jon Tennant](http://fossilsandshit.com/) who has agreed to serve on an advisory board we are in the course of establishing.

Kade sketched out the basic functionality of Aletheia after watching the documentary *The Internet's Own Boy, The Story of Aaron Swartz*. The documentary opened his eyes to the problems in academic publishing, enough so that he wanted to see what he could do about them. Kade appraoched Roo, a fellow decentralistion and blockchain enthusiast, to help build Aletheia. Neither Kade or Roo have formal academic publishing experience, which is why they've surrounded themselves with volunteers, many who do have academic publishing experience, to help guide the project. What they do bring to the project is a unique take on privacy, security and resiliency, ensuring that Aletheia will be software that stands the test of time. Both Kade and Roo are involved in activism and also bring to the project a strong purpose of community building. The skill sets of the founders are embodied in the spirit of Aletheia, that the project is both software and people, both hand in hand to create a better world.
